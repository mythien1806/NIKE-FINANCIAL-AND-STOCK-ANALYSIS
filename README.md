# Nike-Financial-Stock-Analysis
## Business Question.
Financial Analysis was applied to perform a valuation of Nike current share price whether or not this company is a good investment opportunity and make recommendation to shareholders to Sell, Hold, or Buy.
## Data Collection & Processing
The data was comprised of standardized Balance Sheet, Income Statement and other Financial Reports over the last 10 years of Nike and its competitors Adidas, Puma, Columbia Sportswear, Skechers, Under Armour, and Asics which were downloaded in same scales of thousand from database Mergent Online. Daily closed price of stock history of those companies and S&P 500 were taken directly from Yahoo Finance from period 2011 to end of 2021. 

Balance Sheet and Income Statement are used to compute Financial Ratios for each company. Average of six competitorsâ€™ ratios are considered as Industry Index to compare to Nike. From that, Discounted Cashflow and Relative Model were generated to provide Nike projected stock price.
Stock history was reorganized from oldest to newest, then I calculated stock returns and excess returns for each company. 
All the data processing and preparation were done in excel and results were loaded into Power BI for further visualization and analysis.
## Executive Summary
Nike is the world's largest supplier of athletic shoes and apparel and a major manufacturer of sports equipment, with revenue in excess of US$44.5 billion in 2020. This year is the evidence that Nike has regained its growth momentum in a remarkable way after losing sales in 2019 due to the pandemic.
